  "content": "\n                Common patterns for LangGraph applications:\n                \n                1. Plan-Execute Pattern:\n                   - Separate planning and execution phases\n                   - Planning creates detailed step-by-step plans\n                   - Execution follows plans with dynamic routing\n                \n                2. Multi-Agent Collaboration:\n                   - Specialized agents for different tasks\n                   - Message passing between agents\n                   - Coordination and orchestration layers\n                \n                3. State Management:\n                   - Comprehensive state schemas\n                   - Checkpointing for resumability\n                   - State validation and consistency\n                \n                4. Tool Integration:\n                   - Native tool calling\n                   - Error handling for tool failures\n                   - Tool result validation\n                \n                5. Human-in-the-Loop:\n                   - Breakpoints for human input\n                   - Approval workflows\n                   - Interactive debugging\n                ",
