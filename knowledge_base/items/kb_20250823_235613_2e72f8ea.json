  "content": "\n                Key principles for designing AI agents:\n                \n                1. Clear Goal Definition - Agents should have well-defined objectives\n                2. State Management - Maintain comprehensive state across interactions\n                3. Tool Integration - Seamless integration with external tools and APIs\n                4. Error Handling - Robust error recovery and fallback mechanisms\n                5. Human Oversight - Ability for human intervention and control\n                6. Transparency - Clear reasoning and decision-making processes\n                7. Iterative Improvement - Continuous learning and adaptation\n                8. Safety Constraints - Built-in safety measures and limitations\n                9. Scalability - Design for concurrent and distributed execution\n                10. Monitoring - Real-time monitoring of agent behavior and performance\n                ",
