Separation of Concerns - Each component should have a single responsibility\n                2. Loose Coupling - Components should be independently deployable and testable\n                3. High Cohesion - Related functionality should be grouped together\n                4. Scalability - Design for growth and performance requirements\n                5. Security by Design - Security considerations at every layer\n                6. Observability - Built-in monitoring, logging, and tracing\n                7. Fault Tolerance - Graceful degradation and error recovery\n                8. Documentation - Clear documentation for all components\n                ",
